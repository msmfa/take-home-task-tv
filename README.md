# Trading View Take home task

### A few notes for whomever reviews this:

- I've used CSS modules and no particular naming convention so as to keep the task as simple as possible.
- I've used Vite as it's the quickest way to scaffold a quick React project with Typescript. There is probably some left over Vite config that isn't needed.
- I've intentionally been very minimal in certain aspects such as accessiblity and functionality. Accessibilty and SEO in particular are hard to implement without knowing the level of each the particular project uses so I've been very minimal in my use of both, e.g,. My text component only renders a <p>, minimal aria-labels etc.
- I've abstracted away some functions that are only used once and organised things in folders even though on a small project like this it's not needed, as I thought it's useful to get an overview of what kind of patterns I like using etc.
- I haven't developed full functionality on certain elements, e.g. the buttons could be disabled and have a left button when at the end of the array. I didn't want to spend too much time on these details.
- I saw the arrow is removed on 320px so I disabled it but wasn't sure that was intentional.
